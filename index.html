        <h2> mission </h2>
        <p> As a multidisciplinary HCI and UX researcher from a social science background, I'm inspired by people and problems -- often thinking about individual-level and societal-level impacts.
          I explore creative learning opportunities aligned with my aspirations to build experiences that equitably and ethically advance digital wellbeing. 
          I'm specifically interested in democratizing the movement for humane technology by empowering the general public with an understanding of how their day-to-day interactions involving technology impact their emotional, psychological, and cognitive states.
        </p>
  
        <br>

        <h2> experiences </h2>
        <p>
         Through experiences in both a startup-like scene in academia and face-paced environmentment in industry, I've worked on projects involving a wide range of research methods and emerging technologies ranging from mobile health research, virtual reality, and autonomous movements for telepresence robots to consumer and enterprise products.
         Chasing my curiosities through a unique breadth of opportunities, I've embraced cross-disciplinary collaboration in applying UX techniques and supporting social impact initiatives to a diversity of domains ranging from Google’s ad-tech space and The Wall Street Journal to involvements in Cornell Tech’s Digital Life Initiative.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
         Currently, I'm a researcher and project manager in Cornell University’s Social Media Lab and Weill Cornell Medicine’s Patient Decision Support Lab. 
         At Cornell SML, I work on projects supporting Social Media TestDrive, which aims to teach kids digital literacy and citizenship skills through experiential learning; I'm leading a research study on empowering resource-challenged parents in helping their kids navigate privacy risks online.
         At WCM, I collaborate with clinical practitioner and a bioinformatics group on a variety of projects, such as a study on bioethics and a validation study involving mobile health technologies to conduct remote health assessments.
        </p>
    
        <br>

        <h2> activities </h2>
        <p>
          Outside of my day job, I'm involved in activities pertaining to wellbeing and UX. 
          I'm an ambassador for this year's National Day of Unplugging, which is a campaign to raise awareness for mindful technology use through community events.
          I also support a team working on mentorship and community engagement programming for the NYC chapter of Hexagon UX, a professional network supporting women and non-binary folks in UX. 
          In october 2020, I was an invited luminary speaker at the annual Adobe MAX creativity conference where I talked about the meaning of time well spent and the limitations of using screentime as a proxy for digital wellbeing.
